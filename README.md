# Animal-Adoption-Database
A web application that allows the user to view animals up for adoption. This app incorporates the use of React.js, mongoDB and API routes.

## Description

For this project, we created an animal rescue adoption database. This application manages a table of users through MongoDB which contains their login information as well as rescue animals stored to their profile. The front end of our application serves as an interface for any user to view the available animals. If logged in, users have the opportunity to 'save' or 'favorite' specific animals to their profile.  The back end of our application utilizes the Rescuegroups.org HTTP/JSON API to perform `GET`, `POST`, `DELETE`, and `PUT` requests on the information, as requested by front end input. Our folder structure was built around the MVC paradigm, to ensure smooth development between the four collaborators on this project. Additionally, we practiced agile project management to help ensure that we kept pace with our development timeline.
